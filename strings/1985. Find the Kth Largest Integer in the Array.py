# You are given an array of strings nums and an integer k. Each string in nums represents an integer without leading zeros.

# Return the string that represents the kth largest integer in nums.

# Note: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if nums is ["1","2","2"], "2" is the first largest integer, 
# "2" is the second-largest integer, and "1" is the third-largest integer.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4
# Output: "3"
# Explanation:
# The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["3","6","7","10"].
# The 4th largest integer in nums is "3".
